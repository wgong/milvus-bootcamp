    "We'll combine ideas from three RAG papers into a RAG agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Routing:**  Adaptive RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403)). Route questions to different retrieval approaches\n",
    "- **Fallback:** Corrective RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15884.pdf)). Fallback to web search if docs are not relevant to query\n",
    "- **Self-correction:** Self-RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)). Fix answers w/ hallucinations or donâ€™t address question\n",

    "![langgraph_adaptive_rag.png](imgs/RAG_Agent_langGraph.png)\n",

    "Note that this will incorperate [a few general ideas for agents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reflection**: The self-correction mechanism is a form of reflection, where the LangGraph agent reflects on its retrieval and generations\n",
    "- **Planning**: The control flow laid out in the graph is a form of planning \n",
    "- **Tool use**: Specific nodes in the control flow (e.g., web search) will use tools\n",

Iâ€™ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\\\nTypes of Memory#\\\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds.

Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\\\n\\\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFig. 8.

Close to an hour after the Bears drafted Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, they remained at their No. 9 pick to take Washington wide receiver Rome Odunze. And the Bears' new quarterback offered an energetic response while watching backstage.\\\\nHere's a full list of the Bears picks- as things stand right now- for the 2024 NFL Draft: First round: No. 1 overall (via Carolina) First round: No. 9 overall\\\\nRound\\\\nPick\\\\n1\\\\n1\\\\n1\\\\n9\\\\n3\\\\n75\\\\n4\\\\n111\\\\n4\\\\n123\\\\n5\\\\n143\\\\nThe extra first-round pick comes by way of Carolina, who would have otherwise had the first overall selection.\\\\n Bears draft picks in 2025\\\\nThe only change in 2025 picks is the Chase Claypool trade, which sent Miami a seventh-rounder along with the wide receiver for a sixth-round pick from the Dolphins.\\\\n Bears draft picks in 2024, 2025 & Beyond: Full list\\\\nWelcome to the 2024 offseason; the offseason where Ryan Poles and the Chicago Bears own all of the power.\\\\n QB Kyler Murray (ARI)\\\\n2018: QB Baker Mayfield (CLE)\\\\n2017: QB Myles Garrett (CLE)\\\\n2016: QB Jared Goff (LAR)\\\\n2015: QB Jameis Winston (TB)\\\\n The Bears not only own the no. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, but also have the league's third-highest amount of cap space.\\\\n\\\\nThe Bears on Thursday, as expected, selected USC quarterback Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft.
